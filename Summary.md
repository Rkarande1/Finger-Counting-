The Project utilizes OpenCV for real-time hand gesture recognition. It begins by capturing video frames from the webcam, and after initializing variables and defining a region of interest (ROI) for hand detection, it calculates the average background to distinguish the hand from the background. Through background subtraction and contour analysis, it segments the hand region and counts the number of fingers raised, displaying the results on the video feed. This process continues until the user interrupts by pressing the Esc key, after which the camera is released and all windows are closed.
